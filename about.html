          <p>My name is Austin Spraggins, and I used to be a local truck driver.
            <p>
              After much consideration, I decided to leave that industry and return to college to achieve my Certificate in Web Design and Web Design Associate In Science Degree: Information Systems. Certifications and Degrees in the two fields of technology I thoroughly cherish.
